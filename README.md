# Adjust-Text-To-Background.js

It's a jQuery plugin for adjusting text color to your background color. If the background color is brighter script will change text color to black, if the background is less brighter it will be changed for white.
## Installation

Add jQuery to your html, and then add the plugin file

```bash
<script src="adjust-text-to-background.js"></script>
```

## Usage
Set the div or other for the script with using the ```adjust-text ``` class
```html
<div class="adjust-text" style="background: red; text-align: center;">
    <h1>Example text</h1>
</div>
```
and that's all. Script will find your determined tags, and will adjust text color :)
